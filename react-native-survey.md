**How to Run an In-App Survey in Your React Native App**

Introduction:

In-app surveys are an essential tool for gathering real-time feedback from users, helping developers and product teams enhance the user experience. By collecting feedback directly within the app, you can capture insights when user engagement is at its peak, allowing for data-driven improvements and more personalized features.
In this article, we'll walk you through the process of integrating an in-app survey into a React Native application. This will help you gather valuable user feedback directly within your app. We'll use Formbricks as an example for handling survey creation and data collection.

Prerequisites:

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A Formbricks account
- A React Native project set up
- Basic knowledge of React Native


Set Up Formbricks:

1. Sign Up/Log In to Formbricks: Visit the [Formbricks website](https://formbricks.com) and sign up for a new account or log in if you already have one.
2. Create a New Survey: Follow the instructions to create a new survey tailored to your needs. Customize the questions and appearance as required.


Step-by-Step Guide: Integrating an In-App Survey:

1. Setting Up Your React Native Environment:
   
Before you can begin, make sure you have a React Native environment set up. If not, follow the official React Native documentation to get started. Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

a. Node.js

b. React Native CLI or Expo CLI (depending on your preference)

c. A code editor (like VS Code)

Once your environment is ready, create a new React Native project:

2. Installing the Required Packages:
   
To run in-app surveys, you'll need to install the Formbricks SDK or any other similar tool for survey management.

This command will install the Formbricks SDK, which you’ll use to embed surveys into your app.


3. Configuring Formbricks in React Native:

Next, import the Formbricks components into your application. Typically, you’ll place the survey trigger in a component that fits naturally within your app’s workflow, such as after completing a purchase, signing up, or achieving a milestone.

Here’s a simple example of how to integrate the survey:

In this example:

a. We import the Formbricks component.

b. A button is added that triggers the survey when clicked.

c. The survey ID is fetched from your Formbricks dashboard, allowing you to display the appropriate survey.


4. Customizing the Survey:

Formbricks allows you to customize the survey’s appearance and behavior to fit your app’s look and feel. You can modify colors, text, and even the type of questions shown. For example, adding custom fields like star ratings, multiple-choice questions, or text input fields.

Here’s an example of how to customize the survey:

In this case, the theme property adjusts the primary and secondary colors of the survey UI, creating a more cohesive user experience that matches your app's branding.


5. Triggering the Survey at Key Moments:

To maximize engagement, it’s crucial to trigger the survey at moments when the user is most likely to give thoughtful feedback. You could trigger the survey:

a. After a user completes a transaction (e.g., a purchase or booking)

b. After a certain amount of time (e.g., after using the app for 5 minutes)
 
c. Upon achieving a milestone (e.g., completing 5 tasks or levels)

Here’s an example of how you can trigger the survey after a successful transaction:

6. Handling Survey Responses:

Once the survey is running, Formbricks will handle response collection and analysis. The data can be viewed in the Formbricks dashboard or exported for further analysis in tools like Google Sheets, Excel, or data visualization platforms.

We can also add hooks for real-time notifications when responses are submitted:

Benefits of In-App Surveys:
In-app surveys have several advantages over other feedback collection methods such as email surveys:

1. Real-Time Feedback: Users provide feedback while they are still actively engaged with your app, leading to more accurate and immediate responses.
2. High Response Rate: In-app surveys tend to have higher engagement since they are integrated seamlessly into the user experience.
3. Targeted Feedback: You can trigger surveys based on user behavior, ensuring you get feedback at critical moments, such as after a key transaction or action.
4. Customization: Surveys can be tailored to specific user segments, increasing relevance and response quality.


Conclusion:
Running in-app surveys in a React Native app is a powerful way to gather real-time feedback and enhance user engagement. With tools like Formbricks, you can easily integrate surveys, customize them to match your app’s branding, and analyze the results to make informed decisions.
By implementing this guide, you can leverage in-app surveys to improve your product and better understand your users. Explore further customization options to suit your specific needs and keep the feedback loop running smoothly.
